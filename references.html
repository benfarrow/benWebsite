                                                My website is broken down into five tabs. Firstly the “About Me” section listing my background and why I joined the Code Nation course. Secondly the “Improving productivity with IT” writing about my knowledge and interest in technology. Thirdly the “Review” section reflecting on how the website was made and improvements that could be done. Fourthly “Website Software” detailing different codes of practice and legal requirements in making a website. Lastly “References & Contact” listing resources I used in the process of the project and my details. </p>

                                                Websites contain written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements. This firmly categorises them as copyrightable material. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a 1998 law establishing that an Internet Service Provider can avoid liability by following certain rules, including speedy removal of infringing material. As well as the laws covering data collection under the GDPR.

                                                1.6 The accessibility of websites covers more than just disabled access. It also involves unhindered access to a website from various devices, such as mobile phones or tablets. A visually impaired internet user can use a screen reader to translate web pages content using speech synthesisers or Braille displays. As such images will need a text alternative and in HTML, alt attributes should be added to all image tags. [6],[7]

                                                1.7 There are a variety of different filetypes that should be used for websites depending on the content and situation. For images: JPEG, PNG; GIF primarily for small animated images; SVG is also often used for logo style images that require frequent resizing. HTML and CSS for creating and stylising websites respectively. MP3 is commonly used for sound, with MPEG and QT for movies.[8][9]
