                    Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
                    Product Development: IT allows business’s readily accessible information around the globe, granting access to collaborative development of products and improved speed and co-ordination for distribution of wares and services. Not to mention vastly improved customer service opportunities. Secondly management, including sales, costs and the like can be viewed and adjusted in near real time and shared with stockholders. This can be acted on to improve business performance using powerful computer models and predictions of the business’s statistical information. Lastly business can keep up to date and quickly react to their competitors, wether this be in relation to costs, features or other aspects.

                    Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully (what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?)
                    A critical part of making a successful project is identifying and knowing how best to utilise the skills and resources available to your team, in the time available; in other words proper management, including communication  and organisation skills. Skills that need to be managed typically include coding, art, design and writing; which are themselves key skills to succeed in creating a successful digital project.

                        Plan and carry out tasks using IT ( e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.)
                    The primary method I am using to plan and help manage my work for making my website is Trello https://trello.com/b/JtufDz3A/website-courseworksplitting helping to break down the task into successively smaller and easier to understand and complete objectives.

                    Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
                    One of the main reasons a digital project can fail is due to insufficient time management and over-scoping. This frequently occurs regardless of the size of the project, even with experienced companies. This will cause features of the project to be cut or additional man-hours will need to put into the project, increasing the time and or cost in order to complete it. Other reasons involve not fully understanding the limitations of the technology being used, and unexpected technology problems, ranging from internet not working up to server and hardware crashes. Insufficient testing can also cause a product to be released in a bad and buggy state, or even fail completely at a later stage.

                    Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
                    Project age is important, for instance implementing a new type of software to a key part of a long running project would seldom be a good idea, however in newer projects trying out a variety of different software to find what works best for your team can be advantageous. How high of an importance is security for the softwares intended function? For instance is it openly available to the public and contains sensitive data? Does the product value ease of use out the box by consumers? And will your product need to interact with other software, if so it would be beneficial if they were at the very least easily compatible and preferably use the same software.
                    The right technology provides business’s with the agility and flexibility to accelerate and scale accordingly, invest in technologies that will be relevant in the future. For instance cloud features provide cheap, efficient storage and convenient services both to consumers and employees.

                    Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.– How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
                    The prime tool I use to help plan out my work process is Trello, allowing me to make checklists and “to do lists” to easily monitor my progress. This lets me quickly and easily know which areas need work on and where to focus next. It also helps with time management, so I can tell if I am on track to complete the project on time. GitHub is a code hosting platform, and makes it easier to keep track of collaborative and personal projects. Version control helps to keep track my work and navigate among the many versions of the files I create, whilst also maintaining an online backup, which is useful not only as a backup but also in easily accessing the files on other computers, both by myself and colleagues.

                    Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                    The collection and storing of personal data and sensitive personal data under the GDPR rules is a lot more restrictive than before. Requiring controllers and processors to have a specific purpose in order to store data rather than just, we might need it at some point. There are huge financial fines for not complying with these rules, both for small and large companies. Data collection must be a done in a transparant way, requiring customers consent for a lot of data collection, which is most impactful on social media platforms, such as facebook or google. In addition out of date or innacurate data must be erased or updated as soon as is feasibly possible. In general when designing a product try and reduce the data collected to what is needed, and relevant to the product itself.
