                                          <p>
                                                While making my website I primarily used Visual Studio Code with Cascading Style Sheet. I also made increasing use of Trello as the project went on, which I found very helpful to manage my time and make deadlines. Git Hub was also used towards the later stages of the project to keep an up to date backup and allow my code to be easily viewable on different computers. The prime online sources I used to get help with my coding were w3schools.com and css-tricks.com, along with of course google.com.
                                                <p>
                                                <h2 id="1.1">2.2</h2>
                                                <p>

                                                The IT tools selected to make this project, primarily those listed above, were ideal for my making my website. Providing I had the knowledge to do so there was no limiting factor to what VSC and CSS could achieve. Although very occasionally such as with the case of changing the transparency of my background image there was no readily available way to do so, however posts online by other more experienced coders helped achieve a work around that achieved the same result.

                                                        <h2 id="1.1">2.3</h2>
                                                        <p>
                                                I am overall very satisfied with the result I got for my website. Some of the strengths I managed to achieve are: CSS code to easily adjust the transparency of the background images, replacing the bullet points in a list with images, custom fonts and a concise navigation bar. Some of the weaknesses are: many aspects of the website’s content not adapting to different or changing screen sizes, due to a lack of flex in the code, I would also like to improve my excess and inelegant coding.  
                                                <p>
                                                        <h2 id="1.1">2.4</h2>
                                                        <p>
                                                Along with the weaknesses listed above, I would like to implement the following to further improve the project.  Clickable icons that bring up gifs, that would disappear when the icon or perhaps the gif is clicked again, or after it has run for x duration. I would also like to implement some sort of meeting board or forum section where visitors could either make posts or reply to existing posts.

                                                        <h2 id="1.1">2.5</h2>
                                                        <p>
                                                I am overall satisfied that the website meets my requirements and that it fulfils its original purpose, as outlined by the project brief.

                                                        <h2 id="1.1">3.1</h2>
                                                        <p>
                                                I could definitely have improved my efficiency when making my website, I often spent an disproportionate amount of time on a problem, where it would of been more efficient to start working on something else I needed to do to progress the project that I knew how to do. I found it very beneficial to collaborate with others, allowing us to quickly help each other out when we got stuck on certain areas of code that the other had already done or knew how to do. I also found using a Mac was beneficial for easily swapping between monitors and applications using the trackpad swiping tools. Improving the task details, and further breaking them down on Trello would have been beneficial, especially for coding tasks.

                                                Using multiple screen helps with productivity as you are able to modify code and get an almost instantaneous update of how the code looks in the relevant application; whether that be a website, as in my case, or something else. Proper communication between either team members and effectively looking up solutions to problems online, utilising and getting help from more experienced coders in the community can effectively and quickly help overcome obstacles while improving your own knowledge base. Keeping your software up to date and frequent saving of data to a cloud feature such as Git Hub, to prevent potential painful loss of work and time.

                                                        <h2 id="1.1">3.3</h2>
                                                        <p>
                                                I believe we could have done it in teams, however additional time would have been needed to properly allocate work to prevent inefficient overlaps, however resources like Trello and Slack could of been used for this to communally see the progress being made and what needs to be done as well as using Git Hub to share code. Some drawbacks would be that especially at a lower coding proficiency level, a lot of the coding would be done differently, even if the end results would work out the same, and so it may be difficult to understand other peoples code, especially if you had more than two people coding. This problem could be fixed by allocating different people to different tasks; e.g. art assets, CSS, html, and content writing for example. Then once their task is finished, moving over to help the other areas that are struggling.

                                                        <p>
                                                The main digital issues I would test would be comparing how the website looked on different browsers and operating systems. In addition different monitor sizes and resizing the browsers on said monitors to see how it affects the readability of the website.
